# System_and_Organisation_Controls_2
The System and Organisation Controls (SOC) 2 (SOC 2 in short) aims to protect the interest of the user entity while receiving services from the service organisation. This is assured by the attestation provided by Certified Public Accountant (CPA) in issuing a Type 1 report or a Type 2 report. Type 1 is an attestation of control testing for a point in time, whereas Type 2 report as a result of testing controls over a period of time.

## What are the SOC 2 Trust Principles
- Common Criteria Security: The system is protected, both logically and physically, against unauthorised access.
- Availability: The system is available for operation and use as committed or agreed to. 
- Processing Integrity: System processing is complete, accurate, timely, and authorized. 
- Confidentiality: Information that is designated ‘confidential’ is protected as committed or agreed. 
- Privacy: Personal information is collected, used, retained, and disclosed in conformity with the commitments in the entity’s privacy notice and with the privacy principles put forth by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the Canadian Institute of Chartered Public Accountants (CICA).

## What is in a SOC 2 audit report?
A SOC 2 audit report is designed to provide assurance to service organisations’ clients, management and user entities about the suitability and effectiveness of the service organisation’s controls that are relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality and/or privacy. The report is generally restricted-use for existing or prospective clients.

### There are two types of SOC audits and reports:
- Type 1 – an audit and report carried out on a specified date.
- Type 2 – an audit and report carried out over a specified period, usually a minimum of six months.

### A SOC 2 audit report includes:
- An opinion letter;
- Management assertion;
- A detailed description of the system or service;
- Details of the selected trust services categories;
- Tests of controls and the results of testing; and
- Optional additional information.
